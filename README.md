# Hello-Atmosphere

## End of Life

The IoT Platform that this was created for is no longer supported by the developers, so this project should be considered end-of-life. 

## About

Hello Atmosphere is a sample phonegap build tool project integrated with Atmosphere IoT

This demo application should connect to an Anaren "MSDB" programmed with the sample project from 
the Atmopshere IDE called "UI Demo". 

## For the mobile app

1. Use this sample application as a skeleton to build your own projects, simply replace the 
following files with files in your downloaded app source:

    /index.html
    /js/*

2. Modify the config.xml with your projects specific information.

3. Replace icons and images with your own icons and images.

4. Zip the entire contents of the project and upload to the PhoneGap Online Build Tool or 
clone this repository and attach your git repository to your PhoneGap Build Tool Account

## For the firmware

Check /firmware in this repository for the .hex file to program with this example.

Program the MSDB with UI Demo firmware to test BLE connectivity.

## This DEMO has been updated to PhoneGap CLI Project format
